= Blog Business Service

This service provides ability for Blog creation and access to blog project, which has a Vertx HTTP server which
handles blog creation, blog access and create blog comments requests.

In this service Vert.x is used embedded. I.e. we use the Vert.x APIs directly in our own classes rather than deploying
the code in verticles.

All the configuration are available in config

     dev.json - Local setup
     uat.json - Test environment setup
     prod.json - Production environment setup

The build.gradle uses the Gradle shadowJar plugin to assemble the application and all it's dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build the "fat jar"

    ./gradlew shadowJar

Run the fat jar as a standalone runnable jar:

     java -jar -Dvertx.logger-delegate-factory-class-name=io.vertx.core.logging.Log4j2LogDelegateFactory build/libs/blog-business-service-4.1.2-fat.jar

Before running the standalone jar following steps are needed:

     export PROFILE_NAME = dev

There is a docker-compose.yml which sets up the Mongo Database instance. Simply run the following command to setup the
Mongo DB instance.

    docker-compose up -d

You can use Mongo Atlas to visually look into the Database.Mongo Atlas can be downloaded from https://www.mongodb.com/

(You can take that jar and run it anywhere there is a Java 8+ JDK. It contains all the dependencies it needs so you
don't need to install Vert.x on the target machine).

Now point your request at http://localhost:8081 or port which you have configured in config/dev.json

Project also has the following json file to set up the all services in Postman application

     BlogBusinessService.postman_collection.json

All the Test classes are available in Test Folder. If you are using IntelliJ, go to src/test/java,
Right click on com.vertx.business.services.test and Run Tests.

For Performance Testing, go to the jmeterReport and run the `*.jmx` file from jmeterReport folder. Go to
jmeterReport/*blog*/index.html  for more detailed statistics about the performance
report. You can download the jmeter from https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi and go to
bin/jmeter.sh to run the jmx file and run the following command to generate the report

    ./jmeter -g report.csv -o <path>/jmeterReport/blog
